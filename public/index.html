      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>React createClass Components</h2>
    <p>Everything started out with React’s createClass Components.</br> The createClass method provided developers with a factory </br> method to create React class components without using a JavaScript class.</p>
    <h2>React Class Components</h2>
    <p>React Class Components were introduced with JavaScript ES6, </br> because JS classes were made available to the language. </br>Sometimes they are called React ES6 class components as well.</p>
    <h2>React Function Components</h2>
    <p>React Function Components are the equivalent of React Class Components </br>but expressed as functions instead of classes. In the past, </br>it wasn’t possible to use state or side-effects in Function Components</br> – that’s why they were called Functional Stateless Components – </br> but that’s not the case anymore with React Hooks which rebranded </br>them to Function Components.</p>
